// For given function type Fn, and any type A (any in this context means we don’t restrict the type, and I don’t have in mind any type 😉) create a generic type which will take Fn as the first argument, A as the second, and will produce function type G which will be the same as Fn but with appended argument A as a last one.

// For example,

// type Fn = (a: number, b: string) => number

// type Result = AppendArgument<Fn, boolean> 
// // expected be (a: number, b: string, x: boolean) => number

type AppendArgument<F,A> = F extends ( ...args:infer T) => infer R ?
    (...args:[...T,A]) => R :
    never;
